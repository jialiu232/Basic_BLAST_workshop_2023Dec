### Welcome everyone!

<br>

Today we will go through some basic processes of BLAST on the Nova High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters of Iowa State University (ISU).

## What is BLAST?

<br>

<br>

From Wikipedia:

“BLAST (basic local alignment search tool) is an algorithm and program for aligning and comparing primary biological sequence information, such as the amino-acid sequences of proteins or the nucleotides of DNA and/or RNA sequences.

A BLAST search enables a researcher to compare a subject protein or nucleotide sequence (called a query) with a library or database of sequences, and identify library sequences that resemble the query sequence above a certain threshold.”


In this workshop, we will go through the basic workflow of BLAST. More specifically, we will learn how to compare and search some sequences (query) against a library or database of other sequences.

## Preparation



<br>

### Work on HPC

<br>

#### Login the Nova High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters of Iowa State University (ISU).

<br>

You are already familiar with the ISU Nova hpc. Let's log on to it ([instruction for logging in](https://jialiu232.github.io/Shell_101_tutorial_2023Dec/index.html#Regular_Login_to_Nova_cluster))!

<br>

#### Request the allocation of computing resources for your work on HPC

<br>

After logging onto the Nova HPC, you will be sharing computing resources with other users in the HPC system. You can see the detailed information of computing resources through the `sinfo` function. While there is no problem running normal or small commands using the shared public nodes, running heavy tasks that requests many resources for computing may slow down and influence the performance of HPC for all the users. And you will probably be yelled at :( !

One of the solution is to request the allocation of computing resources for your own work. You can request some resources for a certain amount of time using `salloc` function. For example, let's schedule and get on 1 node (defined by `-N`), with 10 processors on each node (defined by `--ntasks-per-node`), for 6 hours (defined by `-t`):

```bash
salloc -N 1 --ntasks-per-node 10 -t 6:00:00
```

After performing your computing on the requested resources, you can exit the resources by `exit` command.


<br>

### HPC functions and PATH

<br>


#### Absolute path Vs. relative path

<br>


- Absolute path: describes the location from the root directory

`/work/adina` is an absolute path / the full path of Germs lab directory on the hpc. You can always visit a directory with its full path:

```bash
cd /work/adina
```

`ls` will list all the files and sub-directories in the current working directory. In `/work/adina`, you can see some files, and some directories belong to some of our lab members, e.g., `millican`, `jae`, `liu2020`, and so on. You can go to the sub-directory relative to our current working directory by `cd` to the relative path.


- Relative path: describes the location of a file relative to the current (working) directory. 

**`.` represents the current directory you are at**
  
  
We can visit the sub-directory `liu2040` in `/work/adina` by:

```bash
cd ./liu2040

# check the current directory
pwd

# list contents in `/work/adina/liu2040`
ls
```

Often times in relative directory, the `.` which represents the current directory can be omitted. So `cd ./liu2040` is the same with `cd liu2040`.

**`..` represents the parent directory / the directory one level up**

While we are in the `/work/adina/liu2040`, we know `millican` is another sub-directory in `/work/adina`. We can list the contents of `millican` while still locate at `liu2040` using the relative path by:

```bash
ls ../millican

# check current working directory
pwd
```


We can go back to the parent directory of the current one by:

```bash
cd ..

# check the current directory
pwd
```

- Summary

Generally, either absolute or relative path is needed while referring to or calling any files / directories / functions on HPC. If you are at your home directory, but call the `millican` directory:

```bash
# Go to your home directory
cd ~

# Show the current working directory
pwd

# List all the contents in your home directory
ls

# List contents in the millican directory
ls millican
```


You will probably get some error: `ls: cannot access 'millican': No such file or directory`. But it would work if you use the absolute / full path:

```bash
ls /work/adina/millican
```




<br>

#### Get the absolute path of a Shell function

<br>

We are now familiar with some Shell functions, such as `ls`, `pwd` and `cd`. The files that encode each of these functions are stored somewhere on the Shell, you can find the absolute path of a function by `which FUNCTION_NAME`:

```bash
which cd

# Or
which pwd
```

These functions are stored at `/usr/bin`. But why here we can directly call each of these functions, such as `ls` or `pwd`, without using their full path, e,g, `/usr/bin/ls`? It turns out that there is an environment variable, `PATH`, on the linux system that was stored with some paths. When a function or file is called without any absolute or relative paths, the linux system will automatically check if the function or file exists in any of the paths in the `PATH` variable and use the corresponding one if exists. 

We may guess that the parent folder paths of `ls`, `cd`, or common linux functions are saved in the `PATH` variable, and that's why we can directly call these functions. We can check the value (saved paths) of `PATH` variable by:

```bash
echo $PATH
```

Output for me: 

```bash
/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/cuda/bin:/home/liu2040/.local/bin:/home/liu2040/bin
```

`:` is the separators of different paths. And you should be able to find `/usr/bin/` the parent directory path of `ls` and `pwd` from the output above. The good thing is you can edit and add more paths to `PATH`, which will make calling your commonly used functions easier.

### Install and set up BLAST on your Nova HPC

<br>


#### Download and install BLAST

<br>

We need to download and install the BLAST package before using it. I am going to go back to the home directory, make a new folder `tools`, and set up BLAST there:

```bash
cd ~
mkdir tools
ls    # you should be able to see your tools folder

# go to the tools folder
cd tools
```


- Download BLAST


Let’s download the compressed BLAST package:


```bash
wget https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/LATEST/ncbi-blast-2.15.0+-x64-linux.tar.gz
```

Find more BLAST package download and install information from [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK569861/).


- Install BLAST

We can install BLAST by extracting the downloaded compressed package with tar command:

```bash
tar -xvf ncbi-blast-2.15.0+-x64-linux.tar.gz    # extract from the compressed package
```

**Command syntax**: utility/command flag argument

1. Utility/Command: The command you run to do your work, e.g., `tar`

2. Flag: Options or preferences for commands; commands may use default settings if flags are not defined; Flag normally starts with one or two dashes `-` which depends on the command, e.g., -xvf. Here `-x` represents extracting files from an archive; `-v` represents verbosely listing files processed; `-f` means using archive file or device ARCHIVE.

3. Argument: Arguments tell the command exactly what you want for a specific action, or the subjects you want to perform an action on. E.g., perform the `tar` function on file (`-f`) `ncbi-blast-2.15.0+-x64-linux.tar.gz`.


Okay, now we installed BLAST! Let’s try it out and print the help function for `blastn`:

```bash
blastn -help
```


Ooops, an error showed up: "-bash: blastn: command not found". But we just did install BLAST! It seems like something is going wrong. Let’s see if we can find the path/location of `blastn` with `which` command:

```bash
which blastn
```

No path found. I already checked the `ncbi-blast-2.15.0+` folder and know where `blastn` is stored. Let’s try to call “help” for `blastn` with its path:

```bash
/home/liu2040/tools/ncbi-blast-2.15.0+/bin/blastn -help
```

A lot of helpful information is showing when we use the full path of `blastn`. Remember the environmental variable `PATH`? Maybe it's time to add the path of the parent directory of `blastn` to `PATH`, so that when we directly call `blastn`, the linux system knows where to find it. 


Let’s navigate to the actual executable code scripts folder of BLAST, and add the path of these scripts to `PATH`:

```bash
# navigate to the bin folder under BLAST
cd /home/liu2040/tools/ncbi-blast-2.15.0+/bin/

ls
pwd

export PATH=$PATH:/home/liu2040/tools/ncbi-blast-2.15.0+/bin     # Add the path of the tool to the environment variable `PATH`
echo $PATH
```



<br>

Awesome! Now we have our BLAST tool set up. We will start the process of sequence analysis with BLAST in the next section.
